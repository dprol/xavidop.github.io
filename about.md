He creates this site as a way to showcase his work and allow visitors to dive deep into his experience and expertise. Resumes are great for a quick glimpse in your background and there is often a lot more detail to a product, project or business one has worked on. This is his way of showcasing the details behind the projects and businesses he has been so lucky to have worked on.

To fulfill his passion for music and friends he enjoys live concerts, football, hunting, fishing, team sportsand many other activities. Start playing the guitar is on his bucket list. Until then, he's have found it rewarding to help others learn all about new tech trends. Check out his [CV](/resume/) for more information.

Best, Xavier Portilla Edo.
